## Create a new page

It's really simple to create a new web page.

Create a new file anywhere with the extension `.html`.

> We'll take `homepage.html` as our example for the rest of this lesson.

Open that file with the editor of your choice, in the lesson we'll open it with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## How tags work ?

### Two types of tags

#### `<tag>Some content</tag>`

It consists of an opening tag `<tag>` and a closing tag `</tag>`. Everything in between is **the content**.

#### `<tag />`

Those tags doesn't have extra content you can add, they are empty elements and don't have an end tag.

The `/` at the end is optional, we can also write `<tag>` and it will work.
It's just confusing for everyone though so please add that little `/` on empty elements to make your code easier to read, since anyone can differentiate them.

Empty tags are elements that you put at one place specifically, that's why they don't have any content.

### Attributes

Tags can have attributes, it's like parameters.

Attributes should be added in the opening part of a tag.

So for example, if we want to add an attribute `id` with the value of `myElement`, we'll just write `<tag id="myElement"></tag>`.

## An example of a simple HTML document

### Code of our `homepage.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Hello World, from the tab</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World, from the body !</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Explanation

#### `<!DOCTYPE html>`

This is not a tag, it's a declaration you have to put at the very beginning to define that this document is an HTML5 document.

#### `<html>`

Root element of an HTML page, it can only contain two elements: `<head>` and `<body>` - we'll see them just below.

#### `<head>`

This is where you'll put all the meta information about the HTML page such as `<title>`, `<meta>` or `<link>` for example.

Everything you put there will not be visible by the user - except for `<title>` that will be the text for the browser tab.

#### `<body>`

Content of the HTML page, everything here - with some exceptions - will be visible by the user.

That's here you'll write headings, paragraphs, images and even more in the future.

#### `<meta charset="utf-8" />`

We use the `<meta>` tag to add a meta information to the page. Here, we say that the page is using UTF-8. This will enable support for almost every characters from every languages.

#### `<title>`

The content of this element will be placed in tab of your browser.

#### `<h1>`

Largest heading, the most important one. We'll see about this in the next lesson on headings.
